    * Write the function declaration
    * Declare the variable
    * Write the control flow keyword

* O(n): list iterations
* O(n^2): nested loops on the same collection
* O(log n): divide and conquer
* O(n log n): iterations that use divide and conquer
* O(n!): adding a nested loop for every input you have
