# Create a cat class

* Create a cat class that extends the `AnimalClass` class


## NEXT

* Test your speak method (write this first)
* override the speak method to say something
  cat like (e.g. "Meow, I'm a cat named fluffy")

## AND THEN

* Create a description static method that
  describes what a Cat is.

## FINALLY

* Test that an error is thrown by your
  `description` method. (write test first)
* Create `description` static method on the
  `AnimalClass` class.
* `description` should throw an error. (it
  is the job of the extending class to
  implement description)
