# React state

## Agenda

* state vs props
  * props
    * object passed to Components
    * read-only
    * pure functions
  * state
    * object created inside a component
    * encapsulated by a component
    * access with `this.state`
    * set with `this.setState`
      * async updates
      * function to set
      * function callback
* data down / events up
  * data sent to children as props
  * updates sent to parent as events
